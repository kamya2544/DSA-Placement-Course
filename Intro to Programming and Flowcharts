# FLOWCHART: Diagramatic Representation of our approch to solve the problem.
            COMPONENTS OF FLOWCHART:
            1) Terminator: Represent Start or End (ellipse)
            2) Input/ Output (parallelogram)
            3) Process (rectangle)
            4) Decision making Block: yes or no output (Diamond/Rhombic Shape)
            5) Arrows: represent flow and connect different blocks
            5) Connector (circle)

# PSEUDOCODE: Generic way of representing logic 
            : in english, can be followed for any language (stays same for every language)
